Explain how to run:

In order to compile the program we will register the "make" command and will create 2 executable files in the names bd and edf.
We will run them according to the type of algorithm we want by the command "./" In addition, the name of the function we want to use, the size of the "queue" and the name of the input file we want to insert into the program. (Exactly in that order with separator gain).

For example:
./bd 4 example.txt
And the program will run and display the output of the entered algorithm.

We can compile only one of the two files by the make command followed by the name of the file we want.
For example: "make edf". and as a result will create only the executable file of the edf algorithm.


*** Using the "make clean" command you can automatically delete the executable files and the .o files that Created.
*** Attaches a file named sample_input which has sample run commands in addition to its output files for the 2 algorithms.

* The program assumes that all the inputs are correct and the input file name is correct and exists.
* The program accepts as input only values ​​greater than 0 and the inputs will be exactly in the format (x, y, z) (x, y, z) with a space separating each three and for a line drop there is only one line drop and nothing more.
